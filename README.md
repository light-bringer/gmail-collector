# gmail-collector
*Initial investigations*

python/node app to listen to webhooks to recieve mails and work on them 
- a server will listen to mail notifications through gmail push notifications, read the mail, do the required job, and complete the process/maybe send a notification?

Required Process - 
Phase 1 : 
 - read mail
 - read attachments
 - save with required filenames as discussed
 - save it to Google Drive as a PDF/change to Gdoc format?
 - parse all data 
 - save it to a database
 
 Phase 2 :
